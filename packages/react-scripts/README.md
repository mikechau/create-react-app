# react-scripts-ts-sass

This package is a fork from the vanilla `react-scripts`, in order to add custom support for [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/).

This package includes scripts and configuration used by [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
Please refer to its documentation:

* [Getting Started](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/README.md#getting-started) – How to create a new app.
* [User Guide](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md) – How to develop apps bootstrapped with Create React App.
